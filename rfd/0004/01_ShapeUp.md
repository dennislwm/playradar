# Introduction

[`playscribe`](https://github.com/dennislwm/playscribe) is an automation tool that leverages on a Telegram bot, a Pipedream workflow, and a GitHub Actions to summarize a YouTube link using ChatGPT.

There are several [benefits and values](https://github.com/dennislwm/playscribe#21-benefits-and-values) from using `playscribe` as a summarization-as-a-service.

# ShapeUp

## Background

[`playscribe`](https://github.com/dennislwm/playscribe) was released with a [well-shaped, risk-reduced option](https://github.com/dennislwm/playradar/wiki/ShapeUp#well-shaped-risk-reduced-options).

* A decision was made to use YouTube's autogenerated subtitle for transcribing a YouTube video, and downloading a transcript using `yt-dlp`, as it is both free and results in a reasonably accurate transcript.

* A decision was made to use a Python LLM-enabled CLI ([fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)) to automate summarization of a transcript.

## What Happened to `yt-dlp`?

Unfortunately, `yt-dlp`, an open source tool, stopped working in GitHub's pipeline due to a change in policy from YouTube, as GitHub's pipeline IP addresses have been apparently blocked.

An error message from a [GitHub pipeline](https://github.com/dennislwm/playscribe/actions/runs/10508253536/job/29111740690) states `ERROR: [youtube] SS4HP4oraoU: Sign in to confirm youâ€™re not a bot. This helps protect our community. Learn more`.
See also an [open issue #10128](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/10128) on `yt-dlp`.

Bets are a few well-shaped, risk-reduced options to review. Each bet has an appetite with a fixed time, and a risk that looks like a thin-tailed probability distribution. In other words, there's a slight chance that it could take an extra week, but it shouldn't become a rabbit hole.

The issue with `yt-dlp` has a risk of a fat-tailed timeline, as finding a workaround may be a rabbit hole. Also, finding a replacement for `yt-dlp` is also a possible rabbit hole as it could result in inaccurate transcripts, or a high costs for using paid services, etc.

## What happened to `fabric`?

A new release of `fabric` 2.0 resulted in a breaking change to `playscribe`'s `Dockerfile`, as its installation process was changed from `pipx` to `go install`.

## Possible Solutions

Rank all possible solutions in order of ascending appetite:

| Rank |  Appetite   |   Tool   |                             Solution                             |
|:----:|:-----------:|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  1   |  Immediate  | `yt-dlp` |            Use `playscribe` on your local workstation            |
|  2   | A few weeks | `yt-dlp` | Sign in using [authentication options][s01] in a GitHub pipeline |
|  3   | A few weeks | `fabric` | Refactor `Dockerfile` to install `fabric` with `go install` |
