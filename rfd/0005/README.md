# Introduction

[SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/SilverBullet) is a note-taking web application stored as Markdown files.

## Abandoned

* A decision was made to move the `silverbullet` project into the `abandoned` state from the `discussion` state, as the project was found to be non-viable, i.e. deliberately never implemented.

* A decision was made to move the `silverbullet` ring into the `Hold` ring from the `Trial` ring in `playradar` due to a lower satisfaction and a higher overhead as observed from its hypothesis.

* The lower satisfaction of having a note-taking web application stored as Markdown files does not significantly outweigh the overhead of managing an additional self-hosted server.
