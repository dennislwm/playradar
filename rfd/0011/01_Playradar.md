# Introduction

[dagger.io][r01] helps you create a consistent, reliable development and testing environment on your local host and ensure that everything your CI can do, your local environment can do too.

1. Encapsulate all your project's tasks and workflows into simple functions, written in your programming language of choice;
2. Dagger packages your functions into a custom GraphQL API;
3. Run your functions from the CLI, your language interpreter, or a custom HTTP client;
4. Package your functions into a module, to reuse in your next project or share with the community;
