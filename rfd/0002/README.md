# Introduction

Markopolis is a web app and API server designed to server Markdown files.

* It allows you to share Markdown notes as websites and interact with and manipulate your Markdown files using an API.

* Run a CLI in your local workstation and point in to a directory holding all your Markdown files and images, and the library takes care of everything else.
