# Introduction

[Markopolis](https://github.com/rishikanthc/markopolis) is a web app and API server designed to serve Markdown files.

[SilverBullet](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet) is a note-taking web application stored as Markdown files.

## Abandoned

* A decision was made to move the `playpolis` RFD into the `abandoned` state from the `discussion` state, as the project was found to be non-viable, i.e. deliberately never implemented.

* The main reason the project was found to be non-viable was due to a lower satisfaction and higher overhead as observed from its hypothesis.

* The lower satisfaction of having an aggregated display of markdown files does not significantly outweigh the overhead of managing an additional self-hosted server.
